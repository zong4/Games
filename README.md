### 🎮 Core Gameplay

- Player sits in front of the computer and answers a **series of mysterious questions**.  
- Each response subtly alters the **narrative, environment, or perception**.  
- The tension builds through **minimal interaction** and **psychological manipulation** rather than combat or movement.  

> The horror emerges from the **player’s own choices and imagination**, rather than traditional jump scares.
