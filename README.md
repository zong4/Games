### ⚙️ Core Mechanics

1. **Single Piece Control**  
   Each player controls **only one piece** on the board.
2. **Dice Slots System**  
   Every player starts with **three dice slots**, representing dice available for rolling.
3. **Dice Consumption**  
   Each time a die is used, its corresponding slot becomes **empty**.
4. **Refilling Dice**  
   When all dice are spent, the player must **return to the starting point** to **refill** all dice slots.
5. **Resource Points**  
   Certain board spaces are **resource points** that **increase** a player’s **maximum number of dice slots**, enhancing future flexibility. In this version, **resource points are placed on grids that share the same color as the player’s piece**, encouraging strategic movement across one’s own color path.
6. **Stealing Mechanic**  
   When a player **overtakes** another, they can **steal dice slots** from the opponent.  
7. **Strategic Rolling**  
   Players may choose **how many dice to roll** each turn. When rolling multiple dice, the player can freely **select the result** used for movement.
